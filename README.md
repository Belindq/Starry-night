# Starry-night
![Project I did for my digital art course. ](https://github.com/Belindq/Starry-night/blob/main/1.png)
Built using Java in BlueJ version 3.1.7 (Java version 1.8.0_66)
Simple program that gives historical information on each techonological advance (depiction is not entirely accurate due to identification sake) when clicked on.
The code is very messy, had to work on a tight deadline, will not be fixing it ;P
